# TODO list

## Swagger needed:
Add operations in its own file
Replace resouce properties by inheriting
resource, subresource, optionalsubresource(arm-azuredatalake)
## Examples needed:
 * Use powershell, or azure sdk to capture Get response for example.
 * Validate generated interface with existing sdk.
 * Verify whether other operations exist (e.g., list locations). Loop in Ganeshan, Nemanja.

Issues:
Some of the examples could not be generated from powershell
Enum "Standard mismatch" 
Autorest Code generation error
We need to use Flatten
We need to validate any missing parameters
